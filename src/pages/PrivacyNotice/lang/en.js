        interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from
        third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain
        ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks.
        Through such ad buying networks, we can target our messaging to users
        through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. The
        information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data
        about your visits to websites that serve our advertisements, such as the
        pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the
        websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on
        third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process

        Note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you
        will no longer see advertisements from us or on the Online Channel
        because your information may have been collected and shared prior to
        your opt-out request, the ads may not be customized to your specific
        interests, or the ads may be served based on your interactions with
        other companies and their websites. When you opt-out of receiving
        interest-based advertisements through the links above, cookies and other
        technologies on the Online Channel may still collect information about
        your use of the Online Channel, including for analytics, fraud
        prevention, and any other permitted purposes.

        employees, or the public as required or permitted by law; (4) to
        establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights; and (5) in connection
        with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud, illegal activity,
        security, or technical issues.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, we reserve the right to transfer to relevant third parties
        the personal information we have about you in the event of a potential
        or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets
        (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture,
        reorganization, divestiture, dissolution, or liquidation), or other
        business transaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also may share the information in other ways for which we provide
        specific notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent to the
        extent required by applicable law.

        <h4>Data Transfers</h4>
        We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to other
        countries outside of the country in which the information originally was
        collected, including the jurisdictions in which our service providers
        operate. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as
        the country in which you initially provided the information. When we
        transfer your information to other countries, we will implement
        appropriate safeguards to help ensure that we protect that information
        as described in this Privacy Notice and in accordance with applicable
        law.

        <br />
        <h4>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h4>
        We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed
        to protect the personal information you provide against accidental,
        unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access,
        disclosure, or use.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Retention of Your Personal Information</h4>
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, we typically retain personal
        information we obtain about you for as long as it is needed: (1) for the
        purposes for which we obtained it and in accordance with the terms of
        this Privacy Notice, which generally means that we will keep your
        personal information for the duration of our relationship; (2) to take
        into account applicable statute of limitation periods and comply with
        applicable laws; or (3) for legitimate business purposes to the extent
        permitted by applicable law. To the extent provided by the law of your
        jurisdiction, you may request that we delete your personal information
        or restrict the processing of such information by contacting us as

        <h4>Your Rights and Choices</h4>
        We offer you certain choices in connection with the personal information
        we obtain about you, such as how we use the information and how we
        communicate with you. <br />
        <br />
        To update your preferences, limit the communications you receive from
        us, or submit a request, please contact us. You can also unsubscribe
        from our mailing lists by following the “Unsubscribe” link in our
        emails. <br />
        <br />
        To the extent provided by the law applicable to our processing of your
        personal information, you may request access to the personal information
        we maintain about you or request that we correct, update, complete,

        section below. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we
        may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the
        information. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a charge may
        apply before we provide you with a copy of any of your personal
        information that we maintain. Depending on your location, you may have
        the right to file a complaint with a government regulator if you are not
        satisfied with our response. <br />
        <br />
        Where provided by law, you may withdraw any consent you previously
        provided to us or object at any time to the processing of your personal
        information for direct marketing purposes or on legitimate grounds to
        any other processing of your personal information, and we will apply
        your preferences going forward. This will not affect the lawfulness of
        our use of your information based on your consent before its withdrawal.
        Subject to applicable law, you may also have the right to receive, in a
        structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, the personal
        information that you provided us with, as well as the right to have this
        information transmitted to another organization, where it is technically
        feasible. <br />

        mean you will stop seeing ads, including interest-based ads, because (i)
        your personal information that was collected prior to your opt-out
        request may be further used for interest-based advertising purposes and
        (ii) ads may be served to you based on your interactions with other
